# C++ FizzBuzz With Unit Tests

## Intro

For some over the christmas break learning, two topics really interested me: C++ and Test Driven Development. I wanted to learn C++ as I am interested in knowing more about low level programming, and test driven development seems like one thing that can really improve code.

## What I Learned

- Basic C++
- CMake
- Unit Testing, google's test framework specifically


## To Run/View

- Pull repo
- run Cmake on the upper directory
- build the test and fizzbuzz executable
- run each as needed and view
